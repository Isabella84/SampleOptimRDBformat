# SampleOptimRDBformat
SampleOptim R-scripts developed based on the exchange data format of the Regional Database (RDB)

Developed by: Patrícia Gonçalves (IPMA - Portugal) 

The R-code was developed with the aim of sample optimization on biological sampling in fish stocks.
The main purpose is determine the optimal number of samples necessary to estimate the biological parameters
used as input data on fish stock assessment. 
The growth parameters, the maturity ogive, the age-length key, the mean age-at-length, the mean length-at-age, the length-weight relations, cv, sd, rmse, mse and mape are computed to be used for definition and evaluation of the optimal number of individuals to be sampled by length class.  

The R-code was upload at 10/05/2019:
